CSCC09
======
This is the Eatz Project for CSCC09 in UTSC, PLEASE NEVER EVER copy our code to submit your assignment, that is cheating! 
Just use this for reference. 

For me I upload to github because I need a backup in case when I gratuate, my school delete everything.

Known Issue at the moment
-> Security side : This app is vulnerable for CSRF attack. (I might fixed this issue)
-> Behaviour issue: Updating is not work nicely. This will be 1st prio to fix either today or later of the this week.
-> Sorting : right now it default to sort by name, later today or this week will have properly sort, like sort by name, venue and location.
